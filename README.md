### About the project:

- There are 5 components in the components folder
- Created all the components as per the designs on the figma.
- They components will render when you move the slider.
- I added the keyboard functionality the slider is also accesible from the keyboard.
- I added transitions on the elements as per the figma design.
- used the useEffect hook so whenever the component will mount the transition will appear.
- Step 1 component have two links there are clickable when client will click on the text the other component will appear and vice-versa.
- Whichever link is active it will be highlighted in yellow color.
- The keybord functionality was not by default in the slider.
- I made that by using useEffect and useRef hooks. Set the focus to the slider.
